# Description

Protect your garden from unwanted animals with the garden defender. The garden defender is a robotic water pellet gun that deters unwanted animals by shooting at them with a water pellet. The robotic gun will continuously scan your garden with a webcam. With the combination of computer vision and a deep learning algorithm “YOLO”, the garden defender can detect and distinguish between a “friendly” and “unwanted guest” before shooting a water pellet.
