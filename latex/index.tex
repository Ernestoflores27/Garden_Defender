Protect your garden from unwanted animals with the garden defender. The garden defender is a robotic water pellet gun that deters unwanted animals by shooting at them with a water pellet. The robotic gun will continuously scan your garden with a webcam. With the combination of computer vision and a deep learning algorithm “\+YOLO”, the garden defender can detect and distinguish between a “friendly” and “unwanted guest” before shooting a water pellet.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Details}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
In most cases, a fence or a garden wall is not enough to prevent unwanted animals visiting your garden. This is particular true for gardeners who like to grow vegetables. Animals such rats and birds might see your vegetables as free food. Or your neighbourhood cat might have taken a liking to your lawn as its personal toilet.

One solution to deter these “unwanted guest” is by shooting at them with a water gel pellet. The garden defender has a webcam that continuously scans your garden. When an “unwanted guest is detected”, the garden defender with aim and shoot.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Features}\label{index_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Detect unwanted guests

Open\+CV and a deep learning algorithm “\+YOLO” was used for object detection.
\item Aim and shoot

When an unwanted guest is detected will aim and shoot
\item Garden surveillance -\/ large field of view

Robot will continuously move web cam left and right to maximise the field of view when an unwanted guest not detected.
